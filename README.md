# Dynamic Website Deployment on AWS with Terraform

## Prerequisites:

1. **Install Terraform:** Install Terraform on your local machine. Refer to the [official Terraform documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli) for installation instructions.

2. **Set up GitHub:** Utilize GitHub for source code management. Create a GitHub repository to store your project files.

3. **Install Git:** Install Git for version control and to interact with your GitHub repository.

4. **Create Key Pairs:** Generate SSH key pairs to securely connect to instances on AWS.

5. **Add SSH Key to GitHub:** Add the public SSH key to your GitHub account to facilitate secure connections.

6. **Clone Repository:** Clone your GitHub repository to your local machine to easily create and edit Terraform files.

7. **Install Visual Studio Code:** Install Visual Studio Code or any preferred text editor for writing Terraform configuration files.

8. **Install AWS CLI:** Install AWS Command Line Interface to manage AWS services from the command line.

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Create VPC with Public and Private Subnets:** Define a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS with public and private subnets across multiple availability zones (AZs).

2. **Configure NAT Gateways:** Set up NAT Gateways to allow instances in private subnets to access the internet.

3. **Define Security Groups:** Create security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to instances.

4. **Provision MySQL RDS Database:** Set up a MySQL RDS database instance for storing website data.

5. **Deploy Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Configure an ALB to distribute web traffic across an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) of EC2 instances in multiple AZs.

6. **Set up SNS Topic:** Create an SNS Topic for managing notifications related to the website.

7. **Configure Auto Scaling Group:** Define an ASG to dynamically create EC2 instances, ensuring high availability and scalability.

8. **Create Route 53 Record Set:** Configure a record set in Route 53 to map the website domain to the ALB's DNS name.

## Usage:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd <project

_directory>
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:

   ```
   terraform init
   ```

4. Review and modify the Terraform configuration files (`*.tf`) according to your requirements.

5. Plan the deployment to preview the changes:

   ```
   terraform plan
   ```

6. Apply the changes to provision the infrastructure on AWS:

   ```
   terraform apply
   ```

7. Monitor the deployment process and verify the resources created on the AWS Management Console.

8. Once deployed, access the dynamic website using the provided domain name or ALB DNS name.

## Notes:

- Ensure proper configuration of security groups and access permissions to secure the deployed resources.
- Regularly update and maintain the Terraform configuration files to reflect any changes in infrastructure requirements.
- Monitor the website's performance and scale resources accordingly to handle varying traffic loads.

By following these steps, you can successfully deploy a dynamic website on AWS using Terraform, incorporating various AWS services to achieve scalability, reliability, and performance.
